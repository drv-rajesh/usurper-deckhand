# usurper-deckhand
Server process management tool for Virtual Fisher clan Usurper.

**Notice: this is not currently implemented in the Usurper Harbour server, nor open for contributions**

## Features
- Fully configurable YAGPDB server task reputation rewards (e.g. QOTDs)
- Compatibility with the Virtual Fisher bot for YAGPDB reputation command generation (e.g. Clan XP milestones)
- Administrator utility commands
- **Check out this project's wiki to learn more**

## Limitations
- Can't send commands to other bots, so commands are generated for users to copy-paste; however eliminates majority of management tedium
- ~Security~ A lockdown toggle and permission command locks are being implemented as a standard security measure, sensitive data is stored as environment variables

## ~Contributing~
- ~Contributions from members of the Usurper clan administration or staff team are welcomed, and members on a case-by-case basis~
- ~**Refer to the Contributing Guide wiki page**~
